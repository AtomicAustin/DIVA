# DIVA
A utility I created while working my first tour as a co-op.

I had a lot of downtime so my boss asked me to create a small utility that can replace a character with another in a text file. 
This has applications to the job I was doing, but unless you understand EDI and how WDI works don't worry about it.

I called the utility "splitter" and thought of another utility that could be useful called "finder".
Finder basically allows the user to search an EDI document for specified data and get information on the data and it's data type.

I put these utilities together in a single app called DIVA (Document Interchange Virtual Assistant).
It uses the DIVAlib, I have a repo for that as well on here. https://github.com/AtomicAustin/DIVAlib

Like my other projects, this isn't well documented... sorry.
