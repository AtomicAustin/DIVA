		**TO DO**
data validation -- wait until deploy

have program load files from a windows GUI -- if this is doable within a week or so

re-do splitter input system to a command system: -- wait until deploy
 .load [file]				//load the file given it's file name
 .load [file] -[delimiter],[rplwth]	//load the file and set it's delimiter/rplwth if known
 .delimiter = [delimiter]		//set the delimiter
 .d = [delimiter]			//simpler delimiter set
 .replace with = [rplwth] 		//set the rplwth
 .r = [rplwth]				//simpler rplwth set
 .replace [delimiter] with [rplwth]	//another way to set delimiter/rplwth values
 .display				//display the current loaded file
 .save					//save the current loaded file -- need to hold on to the loaded file somehow
 .save as [filename]			//save the current loaded file to a new file
 .split					//split the file
 .split -[delimiter],[rplwth]		//split given delim/rplwth values

change the delimiter in finder
splitter ~ to * on an already split file removes newline characters

User Friendlyness:
A lot of issues figuring out commands and how to work the program. Commands were not intuitive and the learning process
makes using the utility not worth it.

ISA's are fixed length. The 4th character is the element delimiter, the last character is the delimiter. Save these each time 
a file is loaded.

Finder:
load [file] -[library] -[element delimiter]
find [value/definition] -[all/more/simple] -[number to return]

ST segment first element is the library, us that to load the correct library.
If the library doesn't exist then pass loading a library, notify user
