::Finder About::
The Finder Tool allows you to [load] an EDI document and [find] various values 
in the document or it's document type. You can query definitons of 
elements/segments as defined by the X12 EDI standard or known elements/segments
contained in the document you loaded.
For example, if you want to examine an 810 invoice, simply load the 810, then 
search for any values you want by definition or file values.
You must include certain settings when executing commands, please refer to the 
finder manual for info.
Your file must be split by a newline character as well, if it's not you can
use the Splitter tool.

Both commands have settings the user may invoke, all settings must begin with
the '-' character.
