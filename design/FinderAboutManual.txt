::Finder About::
The Finder Tool allows you to [load] an EDI document and [find] various values 
in the document or it's document type. You can query definitons of 
elements/segments as defined by the X12 EDI standard or known elements/segments
contained in the document you loaded.
For example, if you want to examine an 810 invoice, simply load the 810, then 
search for any values you want by definition or file values.
Acceptable Queries include:
find N9		*Returns the full line of all instances of the ISA segment*
find CUR > USD 	*will look only at the CUR segment for the USD value*
find Date Time Reference *Will return the library definitions as defined by the
X12 EDI standard*

::Finder Manual::
The finder tool has two main commands - Load and Find.
Load will load any EDI document and it's respective library
Find will search the loaded document for a value or definition
Both commands have settings the user may invoke, all settings must begin with
the '-' character.

load [filename] -[810/850]
	.The load command's setting is MANDATORY - you will recieve an error 
	 if it's not included.
	.As of now, all documents to load must be .txt files.

find [value/definition] -[(a)ll/(m)ore/(s)imple] -[#]
	.The first setting in this example is the OPTIONAL display setting. 
	 The SIMPLE setting is chosen by default.
	.The second setting in this example is the OPTIONAL number to display 
	 setting. This value must be a number > 0 and specifies how many 
	 results to display.
